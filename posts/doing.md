# Why Is It So Difficult To Do Things?

I've always struggled with doing things. I still do! I'm going to talk about a few of the things that have worked for me.

# Work

I didn't like my job, yet I would go to it every single day, and do the thing I didn't want to do. External pressure is better than any David Goggins youtube video or anything of the sort. 

I wanted to learn programming, so I made a bunch of things to speed up work, and my team became dependent on them, they were really badly made pieces of software, but people used them, so I was forced to improve. Having a skill you want to learn be crucial to your livelihood and work, will make you learn that skill.
