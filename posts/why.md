# Why I Made This Webiste

I used to believe, you have to be interesting, and then you write. I now feel as though this can work both ways, the more you write, the more you think and the more you think, the more you write. 

If it's totally personal, why go through the hassle of setting up a website? 

The current state of the web is really, really slow. This site is partially to demonstrate that it isn't difficult to make something universally comaptible, readable and fast. 

Additionally, even if no one is currently reading this blog, I write as though I'm talking *to* someone, which feels less lonely, and leads to a higher quality output, as it's not entirely self indulgent.

In all seriousness though, the site is just hosted via python-flask, on a debian $5 VPS. It renders the html based on the markdown files I have in my posts folder, which get updated whenever I push to this site's git repo.
