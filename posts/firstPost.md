Investing

You shouldn’t need much more than one or two brokerage accounts (at least one of these being an IRA or Roth IRA). You should not need a wealth manager or financial advisor or private bank or anything fancy unless you are actively unwilling to learn basics (If you’re an exception to this you should know why).

You should generally never be making frequent trades unless you have a very good reason to do so. If you are checking your stocks daily or frequently buying options, this is often a bad sign, especially if you’re a young male as you’re then at the highest risk of gambling yet thinking you are not gambling (the market will find a way to trick you. the annual take from this is measured in billions and the literal causalities from it non-negligible). Most assets you purchase you should want to hold for many months, better years.

If you wish to make frequent trades regardless, at a minimum learn about your current tax brackets (long+short term; never over-optimize for time-of-sale to save mere pennies), wash sales (making a mistake here can be extremely costly), loss harvesting. pattern day trading requirements, hedging, and section 1256 contracts (which can be used to long/short the equivalent of e.g. QQQ/SPY but in a tax-efficient manner via futures like \NQ). If you want to become an expert in trading options I would strongly question whichever premise you used to decide this unless it is primarily for hedging.
