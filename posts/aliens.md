From David Grusch (former intelligence officer):

"I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program"
When asked if biologics were recovered: "As I have stated publicly already...biologics came with some of these recoveries." When asked if they were human or non-human biologics, he responded "Nonhuman, and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program"
On when the U.S. first became aware of evidence: "Certainly, like I have discussed publicly, previously 1930's"

From Commander David Fravor (Navy pilot who encountered the "Tic Tac" UAP):

Regarding the Tic Tac object's capabilities: "I think it defies current material science...I think it is far beyond, actually, our material science that we currently possess"
"The performance. Absolute performance...We have nothing that can stop in midair and go the other direction nor do we have anything that can, like in our situation, come down from space, hang out for 3 hours and go back up"

From Ryan Graves (former Navy pilot):

Describing objects seen: "We were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere where the apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that sphere"
On reporting frequency: When asked what percentage of UAP sightings go unreported by pilots, he estimated "we are somewhere near 5 percent reporting, perhaps"
