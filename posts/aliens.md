# UAP Hearing 

[Source](https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-exposing-the-truth/)

## Luis Elizondo (Former DOD Official):

"Advanced technologies not made by our government or any other government are monitoring sensitive military installations around the globe... Furthermore, the US is in possession of UAP technologies as are some of our adversaries."

When asked if the government has conducted secret UAP crash retrieval programs designed to identify and reverse engineer alien craft, Elizondo confirmed: "Yes."

On recovered materials:

"The vehicles we're talking about are performing in excess of 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 g's" (in comparison to F-16s which can only handle 17-18 g-forces before structural failure).

"A small cadre within our own government involved in the UAP topic has created a culture of suppression and intimidation that I've personally been victim to, along with many of my former colleagues. This includes unwarranted criminal investigations, harassment, and efforts to destroy one's credibility."

When asked about recovered bodies: "Yes." (Confirming that the US has possession of nonhuman "bodies")

## Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet (Retired):

"The very next day, that email disappeared from my account and those of the other recipients without explanation... This lack of follow-up was very concerning to me. As the Navy's chief meteorologist at the time, I was responsible for reducing safety of flight risks. Yet it appeared to me that no one at the flag officer level was addressing the safety risk posed by UAPs."

# Pilot Sightings

## From David Grusch (former intelligence officer):

"I was informed in the course of my official duties of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse engineering program"
When asked if biologics were recovered: "As I have stated publicly already...biologics came with some of these recoveries."

When asked if they were human or non-human biologics, he responded "Nonhuman, and that was the assessment of people with direct knowledge on the program"

On when the U.S. first became aware of evidence: "Certainly, like I have discussed publicly, previously 1930's"

## From Commander David Fravor (Navy pilot who encountered the "Tic Tac" UAP):

Regarding the Tic Tac object's capabilities: "I think it defies current material science...I think it is far beyond, actually, our material science that we currently possess"

"The performance. Absolute performance...We have nothing that can stop in midair and go the other direction nor do we have anything that can, like in our situation, come down from space, hang out for 3 hours and go back up"

## From Ryan Graves (former Navy pilot):

Describing objects seen: "We were primarily seeing dark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere where the apex or tips of the cube were touching the inside of that sphere"

On reporting frequency: When asked what percentage of UAP sightings go unreported by pilots, he estimated "we are somewhere near 5 percent reporting, perhaps"
